      Hello and welcome!
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a small, simple list of some of my featured homework. This is a simple list of my work, with drop-down lists that will reveal some of my schoolwork. Simply click on one of the buttons for more information on a piece of work.

    <a class="togglebutton" onclick="javascript: if(document.getElementById('CloudMultiplayerProject') == 'elementHidden dropdown'){document.getElementById('CloudMultiplayerProject').className = 'elementVisible dropdown'}else{document.getElementById('CloudMultiplayerProject').className = 'elementHidden dropdown'}">
      A cloud-based online multiplayer game on Scratch for tech (click for more info)

    <div id="CloudMultiplayerProject" class="elementHidden dropdown">

        So first some background to the project: For one of my technology assignments, we had to create a game on Scratch, based on some saying / lesson. I had chosen to make my game teach people to work together, and made it an online multiplayer game in which it would be impossible to win without working together.

        The game is quite simple: It is a platformer game where you have to jump between different platforms. However, in some levels, you have to touch an objective to make a platform appear. This is where other players will go to find another objective. This makes the same platform appear, so that the players who went to the original objective can cross the platform to make it to the end.
      </p>

        To play the game, you simply need to use the arrow keys or the WASD keys. For more information on how to play the game, you can check the included instructions.
