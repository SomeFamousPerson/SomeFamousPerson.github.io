        If you want to contribute to the project, there are some important things to tell you, such as what we do, and what you can expect to do if you become a contributor.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is mostly just a fun website that we make just for the fun of it. We want to practice using different techniques, and this is possible using this project. However, we will not be taking this very seriously, so if you want to contribute to a serious project, this might not be the right thing, as most of the time we are just going to be messing around with code. This also means that we are not very professional, and that we are still learning some programming skills, so please be aware of this.
      </p>
      <p>
        One thing that might be a great idea is contributing to this project to do what we do: learn programming while having a lot of fun.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, also note that we might not always have space for additional contributors, as we want to be able to manage all of the contributions as we go ahead with the development of this fun little project.
      </p>
      <p>
        Have a good day!
